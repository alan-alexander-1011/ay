# yo, thanks for wanting to contribute.

this is the first time I've ever made CONTRIBUTING.md so...

follow these guides:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch.
2. **Submit a pull request** with a description of the changes.
3. **Adhere to coding standards** and test your changes.

make sure to write the code to my code style:\
1. **indent = space 2**
2. **comment every step(or a big step if its easier to understand)**
3. **MAKE SURE, the LICENSE is always on top of the script as a docstring**
