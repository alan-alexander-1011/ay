## Ay (another yay)
### this program got inspired by yay (yet another yaourt)
#### so what's the difference between yay and this?

>this program is more simple, and the script is easy to understand (except for some parts)\
>this is made in Python. (bc Python is usually used for Data Science).\
>this program is more barebones and worse than yay, but it works.

That's it, i made this for fun, the first version is made in 5 hours.

Install it by pulling this github repo. and you can export to path in .bashrc

```python
def help():
  print('install / sync : used to install things from AUR and pacman.')
  print('update / upgrade : used to update all of your packages and your core files.')
  print('remove / uninstall : used to remove packages.')
  print('search / query : used to search pkgs on AUR.')
  print('help : show this help tab.')
```
