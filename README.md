## Ay (another yay)
### this program got inspired by yay (yet another yaourt)
#### so what's the difference between yay and this?

>this program is more simple, and the script is easy to understand (except for some parts)\
>this is made in Python. (bc Python is usually used for Data Science).\
>this program is more barebones and worse than yay, but it works.

That's it, i made this for fun, the first version is made in 5 hours.
